# The Odin Project To-Do List

A simple web tool for handling a to-do list.
Allows creation of projects, which can hold todos. Also supports editing, and deleting projects and todos.
This tool uses localStorage to store todo and project info, which can then be loaded back on new page load.
Done as part of The Odin Project to practice JavaScript.
